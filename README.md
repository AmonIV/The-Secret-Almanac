# The-Secret-Almanac
A Proof of Concept 2D Sidescroller game made entirely with AI generated graphics

The goal of this project was to test whether it is possible to create a game using only AI generated graphics made by Midjourney and see what difficulties and limitations arise from using this method. 

This game was made as a graduation project for university so it also has an extensive documentation of the development process written in Bulgarian included as a pdf file that has been redacted to remove sensitive info.
